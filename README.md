## Sim Social Feed is a free Instagram Feed Plugin Basic Display API
Sim Social Feed is a free Instagram Feed Plugin, that lets you include Instagram photos
in a post page or anywhere else on your WordPress website.
Keep full control on your feed and app,
since the plugin does not store app data from Facebook this is great solution if you are concerned about privacy.

No app data like App ID or App secret, simply generate your own token from your own app and your all set.

Activate your Instagram account and start showing your feed in posts pages, widgets etc.
No need to fiddle with unnecessary settings your feed is fully responsive, mobile friendly and works with all layouts.
The Instagram feed will look great on any screen size and in any container.

Instagram has limited the calls in the new Display API, no worries once you activate your Account,
the Instagram feed will be cached in the database to reduce API calls, a manual refresh feed option is available,
which allows you to quickly grab new content with one click.
